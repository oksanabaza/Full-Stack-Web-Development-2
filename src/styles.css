/* 
This was the best approach I could find to making my transitions happen without
having to fundamentally reevaluate my routing strategy. I'm not sure if this is
the best way to do it, but it works for the sake of this assigment.

It should be self-explanatory, but the basic idea is that we move the new page off-screen
and make it transparent before moving it into view (like a swipe).
